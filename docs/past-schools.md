# Past OSG User and Summer Schools

Starting in 2018, the website that hosted the OSG User Schools and (original) OSG Summer Schools from 2010 through 2017
was shut down.  The [OSG User School 2017](https://osg-htc.org/user-school-2017) and later are hosted on a
new platform.

Due to the effort required to convert the old website content to the new system, we have no plans to convert the OSG
User and Summer Schools from 2010 through 2016 to the new system.  If you want to refer to School presentations or
exercises, please use the ones from the most recent School.  If there is something that you feel is missing from the
more up-to-date materials, just contact us at user-school@opensciencegrid.org and we will do our best to help you.
